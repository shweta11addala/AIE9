    "1. **User Clarification** - Optionally asks clarifying questions to understand the research scope\n",
    "2. **Research Brief Generation** - Transforms user messages into a structured research brief\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Task Decomposition**\n",
    "   - Unlike section-based approaches with predefined structure, the supervisor can break down research based on the actual question\n",
    "   - Adapts to different types of research (comparisons, lists, deep dives, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Execution**\n",
    "   - Multiple researchers work simultaneously on different aspects\n",
    "   - Much faster than sequential section processing\n",
    "   - Configurable parallelism (1-20 concurrent researchers)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ReAct Pattern for Quality**\n",
    "   - Researchers use `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "   - Prevents excessive searching and improves search quality\n",
    "   - Natural stopping conditions based on information sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Tool Integration**\n",
    "   - Easy to add MCP tools for specialized research\n",
    "   - Supports multiple search APIs (Anthropic, Tavily)\n",
    "   - Each researcher can use different tool combinations\n",

       "\n",
       "## Executive Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "Chronic lower back pain affects millions of adults worldwide and represents one of the leading causes of disability. Low-impact exercise interventions, particularly Pilates, Yoga, and Tai Chi, have emerged as evidence-based therapeutic approaches for managing this condition. This comprehensive analysis examines the scientific literature to provide evidence-based recommendations for optimal implementation of these three modalities in chronic lower back pain management.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Pilates for Chronic Lower Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "### Effectiveness Evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "Pilates demonstrates significant effectiveness for chronic lower back pain management, with multiple systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials supporting its therapeutic benefits. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies analyzed 14 randomized controlled trials involving 749 participants and found that Pilates exercises resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity and functional disability compared to minimal intervention controls.\n",
       "\n",
       "The exercise method appears particularly effective due to its focus on core stabilization, spinal alignment, and controlled movement patterns. Clinical studies have consistently shown that Pilates-based interventions lead to improvements in pain scores ranging from 1.5 to 3.2 points on the Visual Analog Scale (0-10), with effect sizes typically ranging from moderate to large (0.5-1.2).\n",
       "\n",
       "Research published in Physical Therapy demonstrated that mat-based Pilates programs specifically targeting individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in both pain and function. The study followed participants for 6 months and found sustained benefits, suggesting long-term effectiveness of properly implemented Pilates interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Optimal Frequency and Duration Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on systematic analysis of randomized controlled trials, the optimal Pilates prescription for chronic lower back pain management appears to be:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Frequency**: 2-3 sessions per week\n",
       "**Duration**: 45-60 minutes per session\n",
       "**Program Length**: Minimum 6-8 weeks for initial benefits, with 12-16 weeks recommended for optimal outcomes\n",
       "\n",
       "A landmark study published in the European Journal of Pain found that participants who engaged in supervised Pilates sessions twice weekly for 60 minutes each session over 12 weeks experienced significantly greater pain reduction compared to those in control groups. The research indicated that sessions shorter than 45 minutes were less effective, while frequencies greater than 3 times per week did not provide additional benefits and increased risk of overexertion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clinical research suggests that the initial 4-6 weeks should focus on fundamental movement patterns and core activation, with progression to more complex exercises in subsequent weeks. Studies indicate that supervised sessions, particularly in the initial phases, produce superior outcomes compared to home-based programs alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Yoga for Chronic Lower Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "### Effectiveness Evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "Yoga has accumulated substantial scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for chronic lower back pain management. A large-scale systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews examined 12 randomized controlled trials involving 1,080 participants and concluded that yoga is more effective than no exercise and non-exercise controls for reducing pain and improving back-specific function.\n",
       "\n",
       "The American College of Physicians now includes yoga as a first-line recommended treatment for chronic low back pain in their clinical practice guidelines, based on the strength of available evidence. Research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine demonstrated that yoga participants experienced a 1.5-point greater improvement in pain scores compared to control groups, with benefits persisting at 6-month follow-up assessments.\n",
       "\n",
       "A particularly notable study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine followed 313 adults with chronic low back pain and found that 12 weeks of yoga classes resulted in superior functional improvements compared to conventional stretching exercises and self-care educational materials. The research demonstrated that yoga's combination of physical postures, breathing techniques, and mindfulness components contributes to its therapeutic effectiveness.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Optimal Frequency and Duration Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "Evidence-based analysis of clinical trials reveals optimal yoga prescriptions for chronic lower back pain:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Frequency**: 2-3 sessions per week\n",
       "**Duration**: 75-90 minutes per session\n",
       "**Program Length**: 12-16 weeks for optimal benefits, with maintenance sessions thereafter\n",
       "\n",
       "Research published in Pain Medicine found that participants who attended 90-minute Hatha yoga sessions twice weekly for 12 weeks experienced the most significant improvements in pain intensity and functional capacity. Studies comparing different session durations indicated that 75-90 minute sessions were more effective than shorter 45-60 minute sessions, likely due to the time required for proper warm-up, pose sequences, and relaxation components.\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence suggests that Iyengar and Hatha yoga styles demonstrate the strongest research support for chronic lower back pain, with these approaches emphasizing proper alignment, gradual progression, and appropriate modifications for individual limitations. Clinical studies indicate that instructor-led group classes produce superior outcomes compared to home-based video instruction, particularly during the initial learning phases.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Tai Chi for Chronic Lower Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "### Effectiveness Evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "Tai Chi demonstrates promising effectiveness for chronic lower back pain management, though the research base is somewhat smaller compared to Pilates and yoga. A systematic review published in the Journal of Pain Research analyzed 7 randomized controlled trials and found that Tai Chi interventions resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity and functional outcomes compared to control conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Research published in the Clinical Journal of Pain examined a 10-week Tai Chi program for adults with chronic low back pain and found significant improvements in pain scores, with participants experiencing an average reduction of 2.1 points on the 0-10 pain scale. The study also demonstrated improvements in balance, flexibility, and quality of life measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "A notable randomized controlled trial published in Spine followed 160 participants with chronic low back pain through an 18-week Tai Chi intervention. Results showed that Tai Chi participants experienced significant improvements in pain intensity, back-specific function, and overall quality of life compared to wait-list controls. The gentle, flowing movements of Tai Chi appear particularly suitable for individuals with chronic pain who may find more vigorous exercises challenging.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Optimal Frequency and Duration Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on available clinical research, evidence-based Tai Chi recommendations include:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Frequency**: 2-3 sessions per week\n",
       "**Duration**: 60-90 minutes per session\n",
       "**Program Length**: 12-18 weeks for optimal benefits\n",
       "\n",
       "Clinical studies suggest that Tai Chi sessions require longer durations compared to other exercise modalities due to the meditative nature of the practice and the time needed for proper warm-up, form instruction, and cool-down periods. Research published in the American Journal of Chinese Medicine found that 90-minute sessions twice weekly over 12 weeks produced superior outcomes compared to shorter or less frequent interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Yang style of Tai Chi has received the most research attention for chronic lower back pain, with studies indicating that simplified forms (8-24 movements) are as effective as traditional longer forms while being more accessible to beginners and individuals with pain limitations.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comparative Analysis and Superior Outcomes\n",
       "\n",
       "### Direct Comparison Studies\n",
       "\n",
       "Few studies have directly compared all three modalities within the same research design. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses allow for indirect comparisons based on effect sizes and clinical outcomes across studies.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pain Reduction Effectiveness**:\n",
       "- Pilates: Effect sizes ranging 0.6-1.2 (moderate to large)\n",
       "- Yoga: Effect sizes ranging 0.4-0.9 (moderate to large)\n",
       "- Tai Chi: Effect sizes ranging 0.5-0.8 (moderate)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Functional Improvement**:\n",
       "- Pilates shows the strongest evidence for functional improvement, particularly for activities requiring core stability\n",
       "- Yoga demonstrates broad-spectrum benefits including flexibility, strength, and psychological well-being\n",
       "- Tai Chi shows particular benefits for balance and coordination alongside pain reduction\n",
       "\n",
       "### Time to Benefit\n",
       "\n",
       "Research indicates differential timelines for experiencing benefits:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Pilates**: Initial benefits typically observed at 4-6 weeks, with optimal benefits at 8-12 weeks\n",
       "- **Yoga**: Initial benefits at 4-8 weeks, with continued improvements through 12-16 weeks\n",
       "- **Tai Chi**: More gradual onset with significant benefits typically emerging at 8-12 weeks\n",
       "\n",
       "### Long-term Maintenance\n",
       "\n",
       "Studies examining long-term outcomes suggest:\n",
       "- Pilates participants show good maintenance of benefits at 6-12 month follow-up\n",
       "- Yoga demonstrates sustained benefits, particularly when combined with home practice\n",
       "- Tai Chi shows excellent long-term adherence and maintenance of benefits due to its gentle nature\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety Considerations and Contraindications\n",
       "\n",
       "### General Safety Profile\n",
       "\n",
       "All three modalities demonstrate excellent safety profiles when properly instructed and progressively implemented. Adverse events are rare and typically minor, consisting of temporary muscle soreness or minor strain.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Specific Contraindications\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pilates**:\n",
